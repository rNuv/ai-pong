# AI Pong

## Summary ðŸ˜„
After learning some Unity in my Virtual Reality class, I decided to test out the ML-Agents toolkit, an entire kit of implementations of different machine learning algorithms for use in the Unity environment. I made a simple game of Pong and used reinforcement learning to train one paddle to hit the ball. I used multiple agents with multiple environements and randomized each episode to make the training faster and more accurate. The trained model ended up working pretty well with an average reward of 0.88 (1 being the best).
